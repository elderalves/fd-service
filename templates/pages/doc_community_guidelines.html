        <h1>Community Guidelines</h1>
        <p>Last updated: 2024-09-23</p>

        <p>At goals, we strive to maintain a positive and supportive community. To ensure the best experience for all users, we've established the following guidelines:</p>

        <h2>1. Be Supportive</h2>
        <p>Our primary goal is to encourage and support each other in pursuing our aspirations. Always aim to be constructive and uplifting in your interactions.</p>

        <h2>2. Respect Others</h2>
        <p>Treat all community members with respect, regardless of their background, beliefs, or goals. Harassment, hate speech, and discrimination will not be tolerated.</p>

        <h2>3. No Discouragement</h2>
        <p>Avoid regularly discouraging others from pursuing their aspirations. Constructive criticism is welcome, but persistent negativity is not allowed.</p>

        <h2>4. Stay On Topic</h2>
        <p>Keep your posts and comments relevant to personal growth, goal-setting, and achievement. Off-topic discussions may be removed.</p>

        <h2>5. No Spam or Self-Promotion</h2>
        <p>Don't spam the community with repetitive content or excessive self-promotion. Share your achievements, but avoid using the platform solely for advertising purposes.</p>

        <h2>6. Protect Privacy</h2>
        <p>Respect others' privacy. Don't share personal information about other users without their explicit consent.</p>

        <h2>7. Follow the Law</h2>
        <p>Ensure that your activities on goals comply with all applicable laws and regulations.</p>

        <h2>8. Moderation and Banning</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to moderate content and ban users at our discretion. This includes, but is not limited to, removing content or banning users who consistently violate these guidelines or negatively impact the community experience.</p>

        <h2>9. Reporting Violations</h2>
        <p>If you encounter any violations of these guidelines, please report them to our moderation team.</p>

        <h2>10. Changes to Guidelines</h2>
        <p>These guidelines may be updated from time to time. It is your responsibility to stay informed about any changes.</p>

        <p>By using goals, you agree to abide by these Community Guidelines. Failure to do so may result in content removal, account suspension, or banning from the platform.</p>
